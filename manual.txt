LINKS V0.000

When you add links to this page, they will be stored as parameters in the url.
By copying the url and shorten it using a "link shortener",
you can connect as many webpages together you want.
This is a convenient way of sending a bunch of links from one computer to another.
If you have trouble finding a link shortener, just google 'link shortener'.

The maximum characters of an url in most browsers is 2000.
The recommended number of links per list is 4-5.

PRIVACY

It is not safe to store links to sensitive data using link shorteners.

LINKCEPTION

You can use a link shortener to link back to a list of links.
This way, you can build lists or trees that stores all your links under one.
You can also link back to Javascript apps that reads and stores to urls.
All the data is stored in the links themselves, the apps are just ways of viewing data.

HOW DOES A LINK SHORTENER WORKS?

A link shortener is a web service that stores links and creates a hash key.
If you have used Twitter, you are probably familiar with how it works.

When you click on a shortened link, you use the web service to get back your address.
There is no guarantee that the link shorteners will hash your links forever.
They can also redirect you to another site.
If you do not trust other link shorteners, you can make your own.

Because of this, it is not recommended to store sensitive or important data.
