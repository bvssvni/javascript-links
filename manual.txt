LINKS V0.000

When you add links to this page, they will be stored as parameters in the url.
By copying the url and shorten it using a "link shortener",
you can connect as many webpages together you want.
This is a convenient way of sending a bunch of links from one computer to another.

HOW DOES A LINK SHORTENER WORKS?

A link shortener is a web service that stores links and creates a hash key.
If you have used Twitter, you are probably familiar with how it works.

When you click on a shortened link, you use the web service to get back your address.
There is no guarantee that the link shorteners will hash your links forever.
They can also redirect you to another site.
If you do not trust other link shorteners, you can make your own.

Because of this, it is not recommended to store sensitive or important data.
